# FDN Events Mobile App

A mobile application for Android and iOS, implemented in [NativeScript](https://www.nativescript.org/) and [Angular](https://angular.io/) with the purpose of sharing evant details and submitting event feedback.

Feel free to contribute to the source code!

## Run the app

To run the app on a connected device or emulator you first need to follow NativeScript [setup instructions](https://docs.nativescript.org/angular/start/quick-setup).

Run the app with `tns run [android | ios] --bundle`.

You will need to provide your own backend service to handle event data. For a quick setup we recommend using our [DigiSAM](https://github.com/digital-sustainability/digisam) framework.
